# MY FIRST BlOG:
### My self *Simranjit kaur*.Today I am creating my first blog.Well in this blog,I will be sharing experience about my college.
**MY FIRST DAY IN COLLEGE:**

Firstly,I reached College **GNDEC** at early.Then I went to Girls Hostel to allot a room for me.Then at 9'o clock I had to reach college's Gurudwara Sahib for listening shabad kirtan. Well then we went there.I listened shabad kirtan joyfully.Then there was ardas for good beginning of student's first year in front of guru sahib.

**AUDITORIUM:**

After coming from Gurudwara Sahib I have to go College's Auditorium for _Induction_program._ It was mandatory for all students to go there.Firstly I saw my section. Secondly I went to my section corner which was section 'E', I want put my attendence.Thirdly I went in the Auditorium and I took my seat. After waiting for half an hour Induction program started. All the teachers shared their experiences and gave us goods lessons for starting our study.

**HOSTEL:**

All the students were free from Induction program at 1'o clock.Then I went to hostel and went to my room .That day was very hot. After taking some time rest at evening I went to Gurudwara Sahib and there I did Kirtan. After that I came back to hostel ,then after taking dinner from mess I gone to sleep.

**LEARINGS:**

Learings from this for me was _For success it is not necessary to have perfect environment ,these imperfect environment will help us to reach our goals._ Before starting our journey we all should know our interests.So, from this lessons we can say success is based on our _SELF DISCIPLINE._
